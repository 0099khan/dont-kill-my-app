explanation: "<div class='caution-box'>\nUPDATE 04/2021: Is Samsung now killing even foreground services? Could this be real, or is it a chimera?<br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/urbandroid-team/dont-kill-my-app/issues/307#issuecomment-827649020\">Here you can read more details</a><br>\n<br>\nEven disabling the system battery restrictions does not save the app from being killed. Let's find out, if it is a bug or a feature...\n</div>\n<div class='caution-box'>\nUPDATE 2021: Despite Android team promise to enforce OEMs to be transparent about non-standard app killing, in Android 11 Samsung has introduced a new severe (default ON) restriction. Apps can no longer hold wake lock in foreground services. This breaks many use-cases, for instance health apps are now unable to gather sensoric data for their users.\nSee details <a href=\"https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/179644471\">here</a> and read below for workarounds.\n</div>\nWe record significantly increased number of app killing on Samsung's Android Pie flavor. The hints show adaptive battery being much more eager than in stock Android.<br>After 3 days any unused app will not be able to start from background (e.g. alarms will not work anymore). Imagine, you won't use your alarm clock for a the weekend +1 day and bang! no alarms any more and you miss work! We strongly suggest to turn off <strong>Adaptive battery</strong> and <strong>Put apps to sleep</strong> options per instructions below.\n<br><br>\nImportant: The latest feedback suggests even when those options get disabled, Samsung may re-enable them later after a firmware update!\nYes, Samsung - a dominant vendor in the Android market - is now using one of the nastiest battery saving techniques in the industry. They kill background processes and render alarm clocks and other apps which rely on background processing useless. See below for workarounds."

This is a severe divergence from standard Android process management policies. To keep your apps working properly make sure you enable:<br>\n_Settings > Apps > Your App > Battery > Battery optimization > All apps > Your app > Don't optimize_.<br>\nYes, this is a long way to go!

You can manage apps individually or in a group by selecting them then tapping the big **Save power** button. Apps that are sleeping will appear in the **Sleeping apps** list at the bottom (tap it to expand the list). Scrolling further — all the way to the very bottom — and you’ll find **Unmonitored apps**. These are apps that you specifically want to exclude (whitelist) from **App power monitor** evil reach.\nWhen inside the **Unmonitored apps** menu, you can tap the 3-dot menu to add or delete apps from the list. Rather than bothering with any of that, you can just turn off the **App power monitor** feature completely as it has little-to-no impact on battery life and only serves to handicap the normal functioning of your Galaxy device.\nIt’s excessive and in some cases downright misleading, using scare tactics to keep you reliant on Samsung’s software when other Android devices get by just fine without it.\n## Other Samsung phones\nOn other Samsung phones, the path may look like this:<br>\n*Phone settings > Applications > select three dot menu (top right corner) > Special Access > Optimize Battery usage >* Find your app on the list and make sure that it is not selected.\n> Note: If you enable \"Edge Lighting\" for your app, the app will not be able to wake up your screen. To allow your app to wake up your screen, please remove it from the Edge Lighting applications list."
