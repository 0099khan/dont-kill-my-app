explanation: "

On at least Unihertz's Atom L and Atom XL devices, there is a third-party background blocking application. It, combined with other default Android battery optimizations, can sneakily cause apps to not work as expected. Luckily, the steps to fix this are straightforward.
"

user_solution: "

* Follow [other vendors](https://dontkillmyapp.com/general) optimization steps, such as enabling 'ignore optimizations,' for your app.

* Go to **Settings > Intelligent assistance > App blocker**. Find your app, tap it. You can also disable the App blocker completely.

* Uncheck all settings, which include **Boot blocker**, **Start blocker**, **Background blocker**, and **Background cleanup**.
